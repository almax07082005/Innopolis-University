\section{Problem 4}

% The “Mammoth” tank’s electric motor has the maximum power of 5 MW. The tank
% can move (with no sliding) up a hill, which makes the angle of 29o with the horizontal,
% at maximum speed of 37 km/h. What is the mass (in tons, round to 2 decimal places)
% of the tank?

\subsection*{Part 1: Finding the Tank's Power}

\[P = \frac{W}{t}\]

\[t = \frac{d}{v}\]

\[W = Fd\]

These all implies that:

\[F = \frac{P}{v}\]

\[F = mgsin\alpha\]

Hence:

\[mgsin\alpha = \frac{P}{v}\]

Answer:

\[m = \frac{P}{gvsin\alpha} \approx \boxed{102.39 \, \text{tons}}\]
