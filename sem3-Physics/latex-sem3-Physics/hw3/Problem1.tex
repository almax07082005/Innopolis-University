\section{Problem 1}

\subsection*{Part 1: Finding the Spring Constant \( k \)}

The energy stored in the spring when compressed by depth \( x \) is given by the potential energy in the spring:
\[
E_{\text{spring}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

To launch the character to height \( H \), the spring's energy must equal the gravitational potential energy at that height:
\[
E_{\text{gravity}} = m g H
\]

Setting \( E_{\text{spring}} = E_{\text{gravity}} \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = m g H
\]

Solving for \( k \):
\[
k = \frac{2 m g H}{x^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
k = \frac{2 \times 80 \times 9.8 \times 70}{(0.5)^2}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
k \approx 439{,}000 \, \text{N/m} \, \text{(rounded to the nearest thousand)}
\]

\subsection*{Part 2: Finding the Maximum Speed \( v_i \)}

The maximum speed \( v_i \) occurs at the point of launch, where all the spring's potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

Using energy conservation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Solving for \( v_i \):
\[
v_i = \sqrt{\frac{k x^2}{m}}
\]

After calculating \( k \) in Part 1, we substitute it here to find \( v_i \) in m/s and then convert to km/h by multiplying by 3.6:
\[
v_i \approx 133.3 \, \text{km/h} \, \text{(rounded to 1 decimal place)}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The spring constant \( k \) should be approximately \( \boxed{439{,}000 \, N/m} \).
    \item The maximum character's speed \( v_i \) is \( \boxed{133.3 \, km/h} \).
\end{enumerate}
