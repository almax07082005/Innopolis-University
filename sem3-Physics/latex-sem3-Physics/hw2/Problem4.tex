\section{Problem 4}

\textbf{Step 1: Forces acting on Block A}
For Block A, the forces are:
\[
W_A = m_A \cdot g
\]
where \( W_A \) is the weight and \( T_A \) is the tension in the rope. Since the system is stationary, from Newton's Second Law:
\[
T_A = m_A \cdot g \tag{1}
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Forces acting on Block B}
For Block B, the horizontal tension \( T_B \) is resisted by the frictional force \( F_f \):
\[
T_B = F_f
\]
The maximum static friction force is:
\[
F_f = \mu_s \cdot N_B = \mu_s \cdot m_B \cdot g \tag{2}
\]
Substituting the known values \( \mu_s = 0.25 \), \( m_B = 50 \, \text{kg} \), and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we get:
\[
T_B = 0.25 \cdot 50 \cdot 9.8 = 122.5 \, \text{N} \tag{3}
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Forces at the Knot}
At the knot, we have the following equilibrium conditions:
- Horizontal equilibrium: 
  \[
  T_B = T \cos \theta \tag{4}
  \]
- Vertical equilibrium:
  \[
  T_A = T \sin \theta \tag{5}
  \]
  
\textbf{Step 4: Solving for \( T \)}
From equation (4), we can express \( T \) as:
\[
T = \frac{T_B}{\cos \theta} \tag{6}
\]
Substituting equation (3) into equation (6), we get:
\[
T = \frac{122.5}{\cos 30^\circ} = \frac{122.5}{0.866} \approx 141.4 \, \text{N} \tag{7}
\]

\textbf{Step 5: Substitute \( T \) into the Vertical Equilibrium Equation}
From equation (5):
\[
T_A = T \sin \theta
\]
Substituting equation (7):
\[
T_A = 141.4 \cdot \sin 30^\circ = 141.4 \cdot 0.5 = 70.7 \, \text{N} \tag{8}
\]
Using equation (1), we can now solve for \( m_A \):
\[
m_A \cdot g = 70.7
\]
\[
m_A = \frac{70.7}{9.8} \approx 7.2 \, \text{kg} \tag{9}
\]

\textbf{Final Answer:}
The maximum mass of Block A for which the system remains stationary is \( \boxed{7.2 \, \text{kg}} \).
