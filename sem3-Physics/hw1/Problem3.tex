\section{Problem 3}

To determine the speed of the river relative to the ground, we need to use concepts of relative motion. The boat travels upstream and drops a bottle, which then moves downstream with the river current. The fisherman, upon returning downstream, finds the bottle 5 km from the bridge. We will set up equations based on the relative speeds of the boat and the river, and solve for the river's speed. \\

We denote \( v_r \) as the speed of the river relative to the ground and \( v_b \) as the speed of the boat relative to the ground. The distance traveled by the bottle downstream in half an hour is \( 0.5 \times v_r \) km. The fisherman goes up the river for the following distance:

\[
S_{up} = (v_b - v_r) \times 0.5
\]

The time \( t_1 \) for the fisherman to reach the bridge again is:

\[
t_1 = \frac{(v_b - v_r) \times 0.5}{v_b + v_r}
\]

The time \( t_2 \) for the fisherman to reach the bottle from the bridge is:

\[
t_2 = \frac{5}{v_b + v_r}
\]

The overall time \( t_1 + t_2 \) is equal to:

\[
t = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{(v_b - v_r) \times 0.5 + 5}{v_b + v_r} = \frac{5}{v_r}
\]

Thus, solving this equation:

\[
\frac{(v_b - v_r) \times 0.5 + 5}{v_b + v_r} = \frac{5}{v_r}
\]

Here is the derived quadratic equation:

\[
v_r^2 + v_r v_b - 10 v_b = 0
\]

Let's solve it for \( v_r \):

\[
D = v_b^2 - 40 v_b
\]

\[
v_r = \frac{v_b \pm \sqrt{v_b^2 - 40 v_b}}{2}
\]
