## Documentation

As with any calculator, you enter number, then choose necessary button to perform a mathematical operation.

To use 'log', 'pow' or 'root' do following actions:
- Enter number X;
- Push necessary button;
- Enter degree (or base if using 'log').

Be careful with big numbers: this app can calculate super big numbers, but the larger numbers, the longer calculations (because of Python features).

Button 'Divisors' shows you all divisors of entered number.
To continue calculations with last result you should push button 'Clean secondary screen' (it's located in menuBar).
To clear history screen push button with the same name.

Also you can see the dialog window with shortcuts (To see the shortcut for the exact button you should hover it and wait few seconds) by clicking 'Alt+Return'.
